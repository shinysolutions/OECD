Austria;AUT;Q4. Additional Comments;4;"The formal competences of Austrian CoG as an administrative unit must appear to be rather poor. This assessment, as such, is correct, and mainly due to two reasons:a)	On federal level individual ministers have always enjoyed great autonomy; this fact is well known at OECD level (cf James/Ben-Gera, Comparative Analysis of Government Offices in OECD Countries, 21. 9. 2004, GOV/PGC/MPM/RD (2004), 1) and may be related to the traditional role of ministries not so much as centres of policy-shaping, but of supreme administrative authorities, in conjunction with the importance of the national fundamental right (enshrined in Article 83 (2) of the federal Constitution) that competences of all authorities have to be specified by law in a clear and non-ambiguous manner. During the last decades, however, the role of Austrian administration underwent a deep change, supreme administrative authorities having lost almost completely their former judicial tasks (which were transferred to independent administrative authorities, to administrative tribunals and, as of 1. January 2014, to administrative courts of first instance); it remains to be seen whether this change will result also in a reduction of ministerial autonomy.b)	Policy-shaping has always been considered to be the core privilege of policy-makers, not of the administration or its staff, i.e. civil servants lacking sufficient democratic legitimacy. Hence, also coherence of Governmental policies is to be maintained mainly on the political level. Changes in the political system (decrease of influence of the largest political parties) might, however, increase the need to strengthen the administrative structures in the field of policy-making (coordination and controlling of proper implementation included)."

The responsibilities of the Cabinet Committee on Priorities and Planning include providing strategic direction on government priorities and expenditure management.  The Cabinet Committee on Operations provides day-to-day coordination of the government‚Äôs agenda. Public service level: PCO supports, via the Clerk as Chair, several Deputy Minister Committees with policy coordination responsibilities.  These include: the Coordinating Committee of Deputy Ministers, which serves as a forum for discussion of government policy and priorities and ensures coordination across the Deputy Minister Committees; the Committee of Senior Officials, which serves as the human resources committee for the senior executive cadre of the public service; the Board of Management and Renewal, which serves as a forum to discuss major management reforms and the renewal of the public service; and Deputy Ministers‚Äô Breakfast.  Further information on these committees can be found at:http://www.pco.gc.ca/index.asp?lang=eng&page=secretariats&sub=spsp-psps&doc=comm/mandat-eng.htm      At the working level, PCO works with departments to ensure policy coherence within the broader policy framework, so that Ministers have full information to make decisions.  This takes place through central agencies meetings (PCO, Treasury Board Secretariat, Finance) and inter-departmental meetings.  These meetings are typically attended at the director general level (line departments) and director level (PCO)."

Canada;CAN;Please describe in more detail the CoG‚Äôs role;3_9_2_COMM;"Generally, PCO‚Äôs role in international cooperation in these policy areas is an indirect one; that is, PCO does not interact directly with foreign governments to discuss, for instance, financial sector or tax policy. The responsibility for ensuring dialogue and maintaining relationships with foreign governments in such areas of policy resides with the Minister and department in the Government of Canada that oversees that relevant policy area. (Note that monetary policy is the responsibility of the Bank of Canada and PCO‚Äôs role is limited to briefing the head of the public service and the Prime Minister on monetary policy direction taken by the Bank.)That said, there are some Ministerial and departmental activities related to international cooperation and coordination (e.g., negotiating competition or tax treaties) that may require that Cabinet / the Prime Minister be informed, or Cabinet / the Prime Minister‚Äôs approval. In these cases, the appropriate briefing processes at PCO, as described elsewhere in this survey, may be triggered to support a decision by Cabinet or the Prime Minister."

Besides, in March 2011 the Modernization and E-government Unit was created at the Ministry of the Presidency. Similar units had been created before in some other ministries to treat this topic, nevertheless, since 2011, State¬¥s modernization is finally where it should be: at the centre of government, where comprehensive policies are designed towards the whole public administration.‚Ä¢	Some units, however, have been removed from its direct dependency of the centre of government, such as the Environment Commission, which was transferred to the Ministry of Environment, created in 2010. Senior services and native population issues were also transferred to a line ministry; in 2011, the just created Ministry of Social Development incorporated these two offices. Also the Food Safety Agency was transferred to the Ministry of Agriculture in 2011. Currently, the sport agency is part of the Secretary General of the Government, but there is a project presently being discussed to transform it into a new Ministry of Sport."

Chile;CHL;Q3.5.2. Does CoG have a strategy or taken any actions directly aimed at improving or maintaining trust in public institutions?;3_5_2; 
Chile;CHL;Description of trust actions;3_5_2_A;To improve efficiency and efficacy of the State, President Pi√±era¬¥s administration has created a one stop shop for public services (ChileAtiende), digitalized public procedures (Chile Sin Papeleo) and it has gradually implemented the e-payment of social services (ChileCuenta).To improve quality of attention towards users of public services, this administration has increased productivity in the public sector through reducing absenteeism and reducing the total payment of extra time. Besides, public payment time has been reduced thanks to ChilePaga program. Also, the Senior Public Official System was created in 2003. This system is created to professionalize high public positions. It watches over that top responsibilities are performed by competent and suitable professionals, selected by a transparent public tender. It has been increasing dramatically in terms on positions filled by this method.To increase transparency, integrity and citizen participation in State¬¥s administration, legal reforms have been made such as the creation in 2008 of the Integrity and Transparency Commission within the Ministry of the Presidency. Its mandate was to study foreign and local regulations about integrity, propose legal improvements about it, and support the implementation of the laws that are part of the Integrity and Transparency Agenda. Thinking of it as a long-term policy, a year later a Law of Transparency of the Public Administration was passed and a new institution was formed, the Council for Transparency, created to enforce this new law, and governed by a bipartisan board. A second measure regarding transparency was the bill sent to Congress in May 2011 about probity in public service. The object of this bill is to avoid possible conflicts of interest on the exercise of public service, incorporating norms relative to the declaration of assets and interests, trust deeds, and the transfer and use of assets. The honest performance of civil servants allows building a regime in which authorities work efficiently towards citizens. To improve regulation of lobby in Chile, a bill was sent in 2008 but had made little progress in Parliament towards approval and in 2012 President Pi√±era¬¥s administration sent several amendments to improve it. Today this reform is in the last stage of the legislative process. The objective of this initiative is to ensure transparency in public decisions, and that every stakeholder and public opinion may judge about impartiality, attributes and convenience of authorities decisions, without diminishing the necessary contact between the one that takes the decision and the ones affected by it. Finally, regarding public consultation, in Chile it is guided mainly by two laws: the Law about transparency from 2008 and the Law of citizen participation from 2011. Regarding the first one, the previously mentioned Council for Transparency works in increasing citizen information about government decisions. Regarding the second one, it says that before sending out any new regulations, the public institution should consult the pertinent stakeholders. In particular, public consultation is compulsory in regulations regarding small and medium enterprises and environment. Nevertheless, public consultations occur in areas such as international treaties, modernization of the State, and customs.

Chile;CHL;Description of trust strategy;3_5_2_S;Government strategy is based on seven top priorities. One of them is improving Quality of Democracy, and some of its strategic objectives are: to improve citizen perception about its political institutions, increase quality of service, enhance government openness, and to promote a government closer to citizens. administration has created a one stop shop for public services (ChileAtiende), digitalized public procedures (Chile Sin Papeleo) and it has gradually implemented the e-payment of social services (ChileCuenta).To improve quality of attention towards users of public services, this administration has increased productivity in the public sector through reducing absenteeism and reducing the total payment of extra time.

Other problem is our broad definition of Centre of Government, since there are several ministries included in it and therefore responsibility is diluted."

Denmark;DNK;Q4. Additional Comments;4;Please also refer to the general description in the answer to question 1.1.2. Principal initiatives are generally initiated at the Government level (the Cabinet Committees) which set the direction of work, including the political discussions. In particular the permanent Coordination Committee and the Economic Committee are central in coordinating the work of the Government, but by no means exclusive. Important elements are also e.g. ministries with cross-responsibilities, cross-ministerial working groups on special initiatives from the Government and cross-ministerial publications, as well as seminars for ministers. At the level of permanent state secretaries, meetings and seminars are also important.

Additional Comments;4;The European Commission's Secretariat General has evolved from a coordinating body with a focus on procedures and registry/ reporting functions to a coordinating entity which provides policy direction and regulatory advice and scrutiny.

The reform has taken a number of years to implement.

Finland;FIN;Q4. Additional Comments;4;Ministries in Finland have a high level of independence in their own respective policy fields. Prime Minister‚Äôs role can be described as ‚Äò primus inter pares‚Äô although changes in the Constitution have increased the role and responsibilities of the PM.  In order to overcome the problems in policy coordination between line ministries several initiatives are made to remove tasks from ministries to the PMO ‚Äì and some of them have materialized. During recent years there have been attempts to introduce mechanisms for better coordinated policies. Eg the presently used Strategic Impementation plan of the Government Programme is structured around three horizontal policy objectives, which are monitored annually based on data provided by COG. For two Gnt terms there were the concept of Government‚Äôs horizontal policy programmes in use (2003-2011).Evidence informed policymaking has been one of the mechanisms to strengthen coordination across Ministries e.g. by agreeing on indicators for the evaluation of progress in Government‚Äôs key policy areas. PMO promotes and develops these processes.The relationship between the coordination roles of the PMO and the Ministry of Finance responsible for the four-year and annual budget process has been strengthened but is still subject to further development.

For the cooperation with European Union and some bilateral partners in European Union, it's the Ministry of Economy and Finances who is responsable for coordinating international development issues, and in some regard, at the political level, the Ministry of foreign affairs.

If your definition of the Centre of Government differs from the definition used in this survey, please explain the difference.;1_1_2;We have defined the Centre of Government as comprising the following two organisations: - Cabinet and Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, which comprises both the Private Office of the Prime Minister and the secretariat of the Cabinet. - Government Information Service, which provides communication support to the Prime Minister and the Cabinet as well as the Head of State. Both of these organisations are part of the Ministry of General Affairs, which also includes several other organisations, such as the Public Information and Communications Service as well as holding political and budgetary responsibility for several others, such as the Scientific Council for Government Policy.

The formal circuit involves committee meetings of ministers which take place on a regular basis (for example every other Tuesday, on alternating weeks) in which draft legislation and policy is discussed in more detail prior to the Cabinet meeting which takes place every Friday. There are several different such committee meetings every week, each dealing with a different terrain. Some very broad ‚Äì such as European Union Affairs ‚Äì and others more focused, such as a regular ad hoc meeting dealing with the follow-up to the MH17 plane crash. Such committee meetings are always chaired by the Prime Minister. These formal committee meetings are generally prepared one to two weeks earlier in committee meetings in which the relevant ministries are represented at a civil service level. These committee meetings are not necessarily chaired by a representative of the centre of government, although the chair will always be in close contact with the centre of government. Besides these formal meetings, there is also an informal circuit of meetings in which the Centre of Government plays a varying role, sometimes as a formal or informal chair, and sometimes at some distance.

New Zealand;NZL;Description of co-ordination incentives;3_6_5_COMM;"FINANCIAL: Financial tools remove barriers to coordination, such as provision for multi-category funding appropriations that allow a lead ministry with a particular task to work with other ministries to deliver on that task.  A ‚Äúseed fund‚Äù has been established to speed up innovative practice by ministries; a key purpose of this fund is to support work to reduce transaction costs and the administrative burden of cross-agency collaboration.INDIVIDUAL/COLLECTIVE PERFORMANCE TARGETS: The Government has agreed 10 result areas that are publicly identified as a priority for the work of the government.  These results span the work of multiple government agencies and so coordination is a necessary key feature.  Performance against these targets is regularly reported to Ministers, and publicly.Coordination is also covered in the performance reviews of the chief executives of ministries ‚Äì in the annual process involving setting expectations and reviewing against those."

Additional Comments;4;"Additional challenges include:‚Ä¢	the lack of central capacity to work across agencies on areas needing cross-agency coordination to achieve outcomes.  ‚Ä¢	finding ways for the COG to incentivize leadership to focus on implementation, not just policy, budget, legislation and communication issues is a consistent challenge.  ‚Ä¢	integrating enterprise risk management and foresight into organizational cultures that often focus on more short-term issuesThings we are beginning to do well include:‚Ä¢	reaching agreement in 2010 on a new performance framework that adopted international best practices in performance management including setting clear expectations leadership engagement in setting goals, conducting data-driven reviews, and follow up actions.  We have established clear roles for Chief Operating Officers, Performance Improvement Officers, and Goal Leaders.‚Ä¢	Establishing a dedicated team (Performance Improvement Council) to sharing effective performance management practices across agencies (that is aligned with but separate from policy team)."
